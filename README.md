# Agri Apps SDI-12 Arduino Sensor Library
SDI-12 sensor / slave side library for Arduino based sensors maintained by the team at www.agriapps.com

# Stage of Project
This project is still very much under development and in the first phase is only looking to support the following commands from the Master:
* Acknowdge Active
* Send Identification
* Change Address
* Address Query
* Start Measurement
* Send Data

In the next phase we are looking to add:
* CRC support
* Start Verification
* Start Concurrent Measurement
* Continuous Measurements

# How to contribute
Send us a message if you are keen to contribute, the more awesome minds on this project, the better!

# Dependancies
This project is building on the SDI12 work done by https://github.com/StroudCenter/Arduino-SDI-12 and so you will need to install those dependancies first.

# Credits
Credit must go to https://github.com/Jorge-Mendes/Agro-Shield/tree/master/SDI-12ArduinoSensor as I got some of my ideas from their implementation.
